# Customised-Digital-Food-Labels
Third year project

This is my third year project for my Software Engineering Bachelor's degree in Swansea University.

The aims of the project were to create a food diary in the form of a mobile application in which the user would note down the type of food and the amount of it they have eaten. Moreover, it would show detailed information about the food. The user could keep track of how many macronutrients they have consumed for the day.

The application should allow users to search for food in the database. If a certain food is not contained in the database, the user should be able to scan its barcode to add it. This means that as users use the application more, the database will grow and there would be less need to scan barcodes.

Furthermore, it should keep track of the userâ€™s weight and exercise done for each day. The user could look back on previous days and see how much they have weighed, exercised and what they have eaten.
